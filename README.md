# Oil-Spill-Sulfur
Computational Methods project esci umn 
Crude oil contains hydrogen sulfide.  When people spill oil into the ocean, hydrogen sulfide is also added to the water collumn.
This program provides a simple input system to determine the amount of H2S added to the system
While crude, this program can be helpful for understanding our impact on the planet
